# About the story of the game 
This project was made at the end of the Python course that I won following the Mind the Gap contest of Google and supported in Romania by Adfaber.org. You find yourself in a land of dragons and are put in the situation of entering a cave inhabited by a dragon. If you are brave you have the chance to find a cute dragon to share his treasure with you or a hungry one to eat you. If you don't have the courage to enter, you can leave without risking being eaten.
